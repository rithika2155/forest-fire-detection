ðŸŒ²ðŸ”¥ Forest Fire Detection Using Deep Learning
This project focuses on detecting forest fires using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN). The goal is to provide a fast, reliable, and automated system that can help in the early detection of wildfires, potentially reducing damage and aiding in environmental conservation efforts.

âœ… Conclusion
This project proves the viability of using CNNs for detecting forest fires in images. It offers a foundational step toward real-time wildfire monitoring systems using camera feeds or drone footage.

ðŸš€ Future Work
Deploy the model to mobile or edge devices
Integrate with drone or satellite imagery
Improve robustness with larger and more diverse datasets
Use object detection to localize fire region
